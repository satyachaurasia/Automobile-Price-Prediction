Predicting Price of Automobile through Linear, Lasso and Ridge Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). 
 
Many ML model suffer from Overfitting. Overfitting is the result of a suboptimal choice in the bias-variance tradeoff.
 
One of the most common mechanisms for avoiding overfit is called regularization. Ridge and Lasso regression is an extension for linear regression. Itâ€™s basically a regularized linear regression model. 
 
 Automobile Dataset is available on University of Calefornia Website.
